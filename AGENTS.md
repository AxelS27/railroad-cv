# AGENTS.md

> Primary instruction file for all AI agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf).
> Read this fully. It is self-contained for daily work. Only open `docs/` when a task needs that specific detail.

## Source of Truth Hierarchy

When sources conflict, follow this order (top wins):

1. **AGENTS.md** (this file) - workflow & rules
2. **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md** - structure & boundaries
3. **docs/DECISIONS.md** - locked technical choices
4. **docs/API.md** - API contracts
5. Existing code patterns
6. Your own judgment

Never override a higher source with a lower one without flagging it.

## When to Open Each Doc (don't read preemptively - saves tokens)

| Open this | Only when the task involves |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| docs/PRD.md | Scope/feature questions, "should we build X" |
| docs/ARCHITECTURE.md | Adding folders, cross-package imports, new module |
| docs/FRONTEND.md | Any apps/web UI work - rendering, data fetching, performance, design/UX |
| docs/DECISIONS.md | Choosing a lib, DB, pattern (check if already decided) |
| docs/API.md | Any endpoint work |
| docs/QUALITY.md | Before marking a task done |

## Tech Stack (locked)

Rationale lives in `docs/DECISIONS.md`. Don't introduce an alternative to any of these without a new ADR.

| Layer | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| Monorepo | pnpm · Turborepo · TypeScript |
| Frontend | Next.js (App Router) · React · Tailwind CSS · shadcn/ui |
| Backend | Node.js · Hono · Zod (validation) |
| Database | Supabase - PostgreSQL |
| Auth | Supabase Auth |
| Storage | Supabase Storage |
| Deploy | See `docs/DECISIONS.md` ADR-007 |
| Large AI models | Hugging Face - **only** when the project involves large models |

Stack rules:
- Shared request/response **contracts are Zod schemas in `packages/types`**; infer TS types from them so web + server can't drift.
- Supabase: the anon key is public (`NEXT_PUBLIC_*`); the **service-role key is server-only** - never import it into `apps/web`.
- Large AI models are **never bundled** into the app - call Hugging Face (Inference API / Endpoints) from `apps/server`.
- Custom model handoff lives in root `huggingface/`. Put model weights/checkpoints under `huggingface/models/` or exported artifacts under `huggingface/artifacts/`; those files are ignored for normal GitHub pushes.

## Workflow

1. Confirm which app/package you're touching: `apps/web`, `apps/server`, or `packages/*`.
2. Match existing patterns in that folder before inventing new ones.
3. Shared logic goes in `packages/` - never duplicate across apps.
4. Finish → self-check against `docs/QUALITY.md` Definition of Done.
5. Made a real architectural choice → append to `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

## Running & Verifying

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Install | `pnpm install` |
| Dev (all) | `pnpm dev` |
| Dev one app | `pnpm --filter @repo/web dev` · `pnpm --filter @repo/server dev` |
| Lint | `pnpm lint` |
| Typecheck | `pnpm typecheck` |
| Test | `pnpm test` |
| Format | `pnpm format` |

Before marking a task done, run `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test` and check the Definition of Done in `docs/QUALITY.md`.

## Git & Tooling Hygiene

Keep the public repo looking human-authored.

- **Commits:** short and concise, one line, imperative mood. No long bodies, no multi-paragraph messages.
- **No AI references** in commits, PR text, or history. Never mention Claude/Codex/agents, `.claude`, `.codex`, "generated with", or co-author trailers.
- **Template ignore file:** this template stores ignore rules in `#.gitignore` so the full starter kit can be saved to GitHub. After copying the template into a real product repo, rename it to `.gitignore`.
- **Keep local tooling out of product repos.** Once `#.gitignore` is renamed, local agent folders such as `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.cursor/`, and `.windsurf/` stay untracked.
- **Python:** use **`uv`** for deps / venv / running scripts, never `pip` or raw `venv`.

## Architecture Discipline

- **`apps/web`** = frontend only. **`apps/server`** = backend only. No crossing.
- **`packages/`** = shared, reusable, app-agnostic code:
  - `packages/ui` - design system / shared components
  - `packages/types` - shared TypeScript types
  - `packages/utils` - pure, framework-agnostic helpers
  - `packages/config` - shared configs (tsconfig, eslint, etc.)
- **`huggingface/`** = optional Hugging Face handoff workspace for model cards, Space files, and upload-ready assets. It is not a web/server/package runtime.
- **Feature-based**: group by feature, not by file type. A feature owns its components, hooks, services, and types.
- **Import boundaries**: apps import from `packages/*`. Packages NEVER import from apps. Features never import from sibling features directly - go through a shared layer.

## Anti-Overengineering Rules

- Don't add abstraction until used **3+ times**. Two usages = copy-paste is fine.
- No barrel `index.ts` re-exports unless it removes real import noise.
- No new dependency if stdlib / existing dep covers it. If you add one, log it in DECISIONS.md.
- No premature generics, no "future-proof" config nobody asked for.
- Delete dead code immediately. Don't comment it out.

## Consistency Rules

- Naming: `kebab-case` files, `PascalCase` components, `camelCase` functions/vars, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` constants.
- One responsibility per file. If a file does two things, split it.
- Co-locate tests next to source: `thing.ts` + `thing.test.ts`.
- Types live with their feature; only truly shared types go to `packages/types`.

## DO

- ✅ Reuse from `packages/` before writing new code
- ✅ Keep frontend/backend boundaries clean
- ✅ Match the naming + folder conventions exactly
- ✅ Update the relevant doc when you change its domain
- ✅ Ask before introducing a new top-level folder
- ✅ If `docs/PRD.md` is still a blank template, ask the user for scope before building features - don't invent it

## DON'T

- ❌ Duplicate logic across `apps/web` and `apps/server`
- ❌ Import app code into a package
- ❌ Add a state manager / ORM / heavy lib without a DECISIONS.md entry
- ❌ Restructure folders without updating ARCHITECTURE.md
- ❌ Leave `.env` secrets in code or commit `.env`
- ❌ Read all docs at session start - open them on demand only
