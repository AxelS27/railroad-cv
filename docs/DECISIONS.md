## ADR-001: Monorepo with pnpm + Turborepo
- Decision:   Single repo, pnpm workspaces, Turborepo for task orchestration.
- Reason:     Shared types/utils/ui across web + server without publishing packages; one install, cached builds.
- Rejected:   Polyrepo (sync overhead); npm/yarn workspaces (slower, weaker hoisting); Nx (heavier than needed).
- Status:     Accepted
- Date:       2026-01-01

## ADR-002: AGENTS.md as single AI source of truth
- Decision:   `AGENTS.md` holds all agent rules; `CLAUDE.md` redirects to it.
- Reason:     Avoids duplicated/conflicting instructions across tools; one file to maintain.
- Rejected:   Separate per-tool instruction files (drift risk).
- Status:     Accepted
- Date:       2026-01-01

## ADR-003: Frontend - Next.js (App Router) + React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- Decision:   Next.js App Router on React for `apps/web`; Tailwind CSS for styling; shadcn/ui as the component layer (lives in `packages/ui`).
- Reason:     RSC/SSR out of the box, huge ecosystem; Tailwind + shadcn give an ownable, copy-in design system with no runtime lock-in.
- Rejected:   Vite SPA (no SSR/routing batteries); component libs like MUI/Chakra (heavier, less ownable than shadcn).
- Status:     Accepted
- Date:       2026-05-29

## ADR-004: Backend - Hono on Node.js + Zod
- Decision:   Hono for `apps/server`; Zod for all input validation.
- Reason:     Tiny, fast, Web-standard API; runs on Node now and ports to edge/serverless later. Zod gives runtime validation + inferred types from one schema.
- Rejected:   Express (dated, no types, heavier); Fastify (fine, but heavier than needed and less edge-portable).
- Status:     Accepted
- Date:       2026-05-29

## ADR-005: Supabase as the data platform (Postgres + Auth + Storage)
- Decision:   Supabase for database (PostgreSQL), authentication, and file storage.
- Reason:     One managed platform covers DB + auth + storage with RLS; standard Postgres underneath (no proprietary query lock-in); generous local/dev story.
- Rejected:   Raw Postgres + roll-your-own auth (slow); Firebase (NoSQL, vendor lock-in); separate auth provider (more moving parts).
- Status:     Accepted
- Date:       2026-05-29

## ADR-006: Shared contracts as Zod schemas in packages/types
- Decision:   Request/response contracts are Zod schemas in `packages/types`; TS types are inferred from them. Server validates with the schema; client infers types from the same schema.
- Reason:     Single source of truth for shape + validation; frontend and backend physically cannot drift.
- Rejected:   Hand-written TS interfaces (no runtime check, drift); OpenAPI codegen (heavier toolchain for this size).
- Status:     Accepted
- Date:       2026-05-29

## ADR-007: Deployment - Vercel, Docker optional
- Decision:   Vercel is the default deploy target (web certainly; server where it fits). Docker provided only when a target needs it.
- Reason:     Zero-config Next.js deploys, preview envs, edge network. Docker kept optional to avoid forcing container ops on every project.
- Rejected:   Mandatory Docker/k8s for all projects (overkill for most).
- Status:     Accepted
- Date:       2026-05-29

## ADR-008: Large AI models via Hugging Face (conditional)
- Decision:   When a project involves large AI models, serve them through Hugging Face (Inference API or Inference Endpoints), called from `apps/server`. Models are never bundled into the app or run in the browser.
- Reason:     Offloads GPU/serving ops; keeps large weights out of the Node process and the client bundle; swappable model hosting.
- Rejected:   Self-hosted GPU inference (ops burden); shipping models client-side (size, security).
- Status:     Accepted (applies only to AI-model projects)
- Date:       2026-05-29

## ADR-009: Enforcement layer - strict TS base + ESLint flat config with import boundaries
- Decision:   `packages/config` ships a strict TypeScript base and a flat ESLint config that bans importing apps and restricts feature imports to their public index. CI runs lint + typecheck + test.
- Reason:     Architecture rules that aren't enforced drift over long AI sessions; making them executable (lint/type errors + CI) keeps agents on the rails.
- Rejected:   Docs-only conventions (honor-system, drifts); heavier boundary tooling like Nx tags (more than needed here).
- Status:     Accepted
- Date:       2026-05-29

## ADR-010: Internationalization via centralized locale dictionaries
- Decision:   All user-facing text lives in per-language JSON dictionaries under `apps/web/src/i18n/locales` (`en.json`, `id.json`, ...). English is the default and source of truth. The active locale lives in the URL (`app/[lang]/...`); server components read text via `getDictionary(locale)`, typed from `en.json`.
- Reason:     Centralizes copy so adding a language is a one-file change; URL-based locale is shareable and SEO-friendly; typing from the default catches missing or renamed keys at compile time. No runtime i18n dependency needed at this scope.
- Rejected:   Hardcoded strings in components (drift, blocks a second language); a full i18n library such as next-intl or react-intl (more than needed now; adopt later if pluralization/formatting demands it).
- Status:     Accepted
- Date:       2026-05-29

## ADR-011: Hugging Face handoff folder for custom models
- Decision:   Root `huggingface/` is the optional handoff workspace for model cards, Hugging Face Space files, and upload-ready custom model artifacts. Model weights/checkpoints live under `huggingface/models/` or `huggingface/artifacts/`, which are ignored by normal GitHub pushes.
- Reason:     Custom model work needs a clear place that is separate from `apps/web`, `apps/server`, and TypeScript packages, while still making Hugging Face uploads easy from the project folder.
- Rejected:   `apps/model` (implies a deployable app inside the pnpm workspace); `packages/model` (packages are shared TypeScript code); committing model files to the main GitHub repo (large and inappropriate without a Hugging Face/Git LFS flow).
- Status:     Accepted
- Date:       2026-05-29

## ADR-012: Payments via Midtrans
- Decision:   When a project takes payments, integrate Midtrans (Snap) from `apps/server`. The server creates the transaction with the Midtrans **server key** and returns a Snap token; the browser opens Snap with the public **client key**. Payment status is confirmed by a server **webhook (HTTP notification)** that is verified by signature hash, not the Bearer token.
- Reason:     Midtrans is a standard Indonesian gateway (cards, bank transfer, e-wallets, QRIS) with a hosted Snap UI, so no card data touches our servers. Server-side token creation keeps the secret key off the client; the signature check makes the callback trustworthy and the source of truth for order status.
- Rejected:   Stripe (weak local payment-method coverage for Indonesia); client-side-only charging (exposes the secret key, no reliable confirmation); building our own gateway (PCI scope, not worth it).
- Status:     Accepted (applies only to projects that take payments)
- Date:       2026-05-29

## ADR-013: Auth surface - Supabase email/password + OAuth (Google, GitHub) + password reset + avatars in Storage
- Decision:   Build the standard auth surface on Supabase Auth (see ADR-005): email/password with email **password reset**, plus **OAuth** sign-in with **Google and GitHub**. Profile pictures upload to a Supabase **Storage** bucket (e.g. `avatars`) under a per-user path with RLS; the resulting public URL is stored on the user's profile row.
- Reason:     These are baseline expectations for a real product and Supabase covers all of them natively, so no extra auth service or storage provider is needed. Providers, secrets, and redirect URLs are configured in the Supabase dashboard; the app just calls the Supabase SDK.
- Rejected:   A separate auth provider such as Auth0/Clerk (more moving parts; ADR-005 already chose Supabase); storing avatars as base64 in Postgres or on a third-party CDN (Storage already exists and supports RLS).
- Status:     Accepted
- Date:       2026-05-29

## ADR-014: Frontend animation/icon parity for Railroad CV port
- Decision:   `apps/web` may use `framer-motion` and `lucide-react` for the Railroad CV frontend port.
- Reason:     The old Railroad CV frontend already used these libraries for page transitions, scroll-driven visuals, and upload/status icons. Keeping them preserves visual parity while moving the code into the current Next.js project structure.
- Rejected:   Rebuilding all animation and icon behavior by hand in CSS/SVG for this port (higher drift from the existing site).
- Status:     Accepted
- Date:       2026-05-30

## ADR-015: Local Python inference workers for Railroad CV
- Decision:   `apps/server` serves `/api/v1/detect` and calls local Python worker scripts for the deep learning detector and classic ML classifier. The browser uploads an image and chooses `deep_learning` or `classic_ml`; the server returns only the verdict payload.
- Reason:     The existing model artifacts and preprocessing code already live in local Python projects. Calling them from the Hono server keeps model files out of `apps/web`, preserves frontend/backend boundaries, and avoids a Hugging Face dependency for this prototype.
- Rejected:   Bundling model artifacts in the Next.js app (breaks boundary and bloats the client); returning annotated media by default (the current UI needs a direct verdict only).
- Status:     Accepted
- Date:       2026-06-01
